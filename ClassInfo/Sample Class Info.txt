The purpose of a class info txt file is to give LLM's access to a bigger picture view of what the topics 
in the class. This is important for preventing the LLM from making erroneous assumptions about what material
the students are expected to know, and can help it focus on the actual goals of the course.

This might include the relevant text of the syllabus, a discussion of the current unit, or comments on 
expectations of the students abilities or general standards that they should be held to. Information 
specific to a given assignment should be passed in as notes in the command line.
